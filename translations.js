        compoundInterestIncorrect: "Not quite! Compound interest is special because it earns interest on both the original amount AND previous interest, making money grow exponentially.",
        financialGoalsCorrect: "Perfect! Good financial goals are specific, measurable, and time-bound. For example: 'Save €5000 for emergency fund by December 2025'.",
        financialGoalsIncorrect: "Not quite! Vague goals like 'save money someday' are hard to achieve. Good goals are specific, measurable, and have deadlines.",
        
        // New quiz explanations
        whatIs503020RuleCorrect: "Excellent! The 50/30/20 rule allocates 50% to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. It's a simple framework for balanced budgeting.",
        whatIs503020RuleIncorrect: "Not quite! The 50/30/20 rule suggests 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings - not the other way around.",
        classifyHousingCorrect: "Correct! Housing costs like rent or mortgage are essential needs that belong in the 50% needs category of the 50/30/20 rule.",
        classifyHousingIncorrect: "Not quite! Housing is a basic need, not a want or savings. It should be included in the 50% needs category.",
        classifyDiningCorrect: "Right! Dining out is a lifestyle choice that belongs in the 30% wants category, unlike grocery shopping which would be a need.",
        classifyDiningIncorrect: "Not quite! Dining out is typically considered a 'want' rather than a basic need. Groceries would be needs, but restaurant meals are wants.",
        
        savingVsInvestingCorrect: "Great! Investing offers potential for higher long-term growth compared to traditional savings accounts, though it comes with more risk.",
        savingVsInvestingIncorrect: "Not quite! Investing typically offers higher growth potential than saving, and saving actually has lower risk than investing.",
        compoundGrowthCorrect: "Excellent! With 7% annual return, €1000 grows to approximately €3,870 after 20 years thanks to compound interest - earning interest on your interest.",
        compoundGrowthIncorrect: "Not quite! Compound interest is powerful - €1000 at 7% becomes about €3,870 after 20 years, much more than simple interest would provide.",
        startInvestingWhenCorrect: "Perfect! Starting early maximizes the power of compound interest. Even small amounts invested early can grow significantly over time.",
        startInvestingWhenIncorrect: "Not quite! Time is your greatest asset in investing. Starting early, even with small amounts, lets compound interest work its magic.",
        
        shortTermGoalCorrect: "Right! A new phone is typically a short-term goal that can be achieved within a year with focused saving.",
        shortTermGoalIncorrect: "Not quite! Saving for a phone is usually a short-term goal (under 1 year), while houses and retirement are much longer-term goals.",
        mediumTermGoalCorrect: "Excellent! A car purchase typically takes 1-5 years of planning and saving, making it a perfect medium-term financial goal.",
        mediumTermGoalIncorrect: "Not quite! Saving for a car typically takes 1-5 years, making it a medium-term goal rather than short or long-term.",
        longTermGoalCorrect: "Perfect! Retirement savings is definitely a long-term goal requiring decades of planning and consistent contributions.",
        longTermGoalIncorrect: "Not quite! Retirement savings requires decades of planning, making it a long-term goal (5+ years, often 20-40 years).",
        
        whatIsLiquidityCorrect: "Correct! Liquidity refers to how quickly and easily an asset can be converted to cash without losing significant value.",
        whatIsLiquidityIncorrect: "Not quite! Liquidity is about how quickly assets can become cash, not about total wealth or bank balances specifically.",
        positiveBalanceCorrect: "Great! A positive financial balance means your income exceeds your expenses, allowing you to save and build wealth.",
        positiveBalanceIncorrect: "Not quite! A positive balance specifically means income greater than expenses, not just having credit access or being debt-free.",
        responsibleConsumptionCorrect: "Excellent! Responsible consumption means spending within your means while considering the long-term impact of your financial decisions.",
        responsibleConsumptionIncorrect: "Not quite! Responsible consumption is about spending wisely within your means, not buying everything or always choosing the cheapest option.",

        bestSavingStrategyIncorrect: "No del tot! La millor estratègia és 'pagar-te a tu primer' - estalviar diners abans de gastar en altres coses. Això assegura hàbits d'estalvi consistents.",
        emergencyFundAnswerCorrect: "Genial! Un fons d'emergència és específicament per a despeses inesperades com factures mèdiques, reparacions del cotxe o pèrdua de feina. És la teva xarxa de seguretat financera.",
        emergencyFundAnswerIncorrect: "No del tot! Un fons d'emergència és per a despeses inesperades, no per a compres planificades com vacances o compres. És la teva xarxa de seguretat financera.",
        emergencyFundAmountCorrect: "Perfect! 3-6 mesos de despeses és la mida recomanada per a un fons d'emergència. Això cobreix la majoria d'emergències financeres sense ser excessiu.",
        emergencyFundAmountIncorrect: "No exactament! Els experts recomanen 3-6 mesos de despeses per a un fons d'emergència. Un mes podria no ser suficient, mentre que un any podria ser excessiu.",
        
        whatIsInterestCorrect: "Correcte! L'interès és el cost de demanar diners prestats. Quan demanes prestat, pagues interès; quan prestes o estalvies, pots guanyar interès.",
        whatIsInterestIncorrect: "No del tot! L'interès és el cost de demanar diners prestats, no guanys de la feina o un tipus de compte. És el que pagues quan demanes prestat.",

        debtPayoffStrategyIncorrect: "No del tot! El mètode allau paga primer els deutes amb taxes d'interès més altes, no els saldos més petits o deutes més nous. Això estalvia més diners.",

        creditScoreIncorrect: "No del tot! La teva puntuació de crèdit es veu més afectada per l'historial de pagaments i la utilització de crèdit, no el saldo bancari o el nivell d'ingressos.",
        
        whatIsInvestingCorrect: "Excel·lent! Invertir és comprar actius com accions, bons o béns immobles per fer créixer la riquesa amb el temps, a diferència del simple estalvi.",
        whatIsInvestingIncorrect: "No del tot! Invertir es tracta de comprar actius per fer créixer la riquesa amb el temps, no només estalviar en comptes o gastar en articles de luxe.",
        riskRewardCorrect: "Correcte! En les inversions, major risc típicament significa major recompensa potencial. Aquest és un principi fonamental de les finances.",
        riskRewardIncorrect: "No del tot! Sí que hi ha una relació - major risc usualment significa major recompensa potencial. Menor risc no porta a majors recompenses.",
        diversificationCorrect: "Genial! La diversificació significa distribuir les inversions entre diferents tipus d'actius per reduir el risc. No posis tots els ous a la mateixa cistella!",

        needsVsWantsCorrect: "Perfect! El menjar bàsic i l'habitatge són necessitats essencials que has de tenir per sobreviure i viure de manera segura.",
        needsVsWantsIncorrect: "No del tot! Les necessitats són essencials com menjar i habitatge. Els telèfons intel·ligents i la roba de dissenyador són desitjos - bons de tenir però no essencials.",
        compoundInterestCorrect: "Excel·lent! L'interès compost significa guanyar interès tant en els teus diners originals COM en l'interès guanyat anteriorment. Això fa que els diners creixin més ràpid!",

        financialGoalsCorrect: "Perfect! Les bones metes financeres són específiques, mesurables i amb límit de temps. Per exemple: 'Estalviar €5000 per a fons d'emergència per al desembre 2025'.",
        financialGoalsIncorrect: "No del tot! Les metes vagues com 'estalviar diners algun dia' són difícils d'aconseguir. Les bones metes són específiques, mesurables i tenen dates límit.",

        whatIs503020RuleCorrect: "Excel·lent! La regla 50/30/20 assigna 50% a necessitats, 30% a desitjos i 20% a estalvis. És un marc simple per al pressupost equilibrat.",
        whatIs503020RuleIncorrect: "No del tot! La regla 50/30/20 suggereix 50% per a necessitats, 30% per a desitjos i 20% per a estalvis - no a l'inrevés.",
        classifyHousingCorrect: "Correcte! Els costos d'habitatge com lloguers o hipoteques són necessitats essencials que pertanyen a la categoria del 50% de necessitats en la regla 50/30/20.",

        compoundGrowthCorrect: "Excel·lent! Amb 7% de retorn anual, €1000 creix a aproximadament €3,870 després de 20 anys gràcies a l'interès compost - guanyant interès sobre el teu interès.",
        compoundGrowthIncorrect: "No del tot! L'interès compost és poderós - €1000 al 7% es converteix en aproximadament €3,870 després de 20 anys, molt més del que proporcionaria l'interès simple.",
        startInvestingWhenCorrect: "Perfect! Començar d'hora maximitza el poder de l'interès compost. Fins i tot petites quantitats invertides d'hora poden créixer significativament amb el temps.",
        startInvestingWhenIncorrect: "No del tot! El temps és el teu major actiu en les inversions. Començar d'hora, fins i tot amb petites quantitats, deixa que l'interès compost faci la seva màgia.",

        shortTermGoalIncorrect: "No del tot! Estalviar per a un telèfon és usualment un objectiu a curt termini (menys d'1 any), mentre que cases i jubilació són objectius molt més a llarg termini.",
        mediumTermGoalCorrect: "Excel·lent! La compra d'un cotxe típicament pren 1-5 anys de planificació i estalvi, fent que sigui un objectiu financer a mitjà termini perfecte.",
        mediumTermGoalIncorrect: "No del tot! Estalviar per a un cotxe típicament pren 1-5 anys, fent que sigui un objectiu a mitjà termini en lloc de curt o llarg termini.",

        whatIsLiquidityIncorrect: "No del tot! La liquiditat és sobre què tan ràpid els actius poden convertir-se en efectiu, no sobre riquesa total o saldos bancaris específicament.",
